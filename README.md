Teaching material about public key cryptography

OVERVIEW
========
This repository contains some very basic material for learning about public-key cryptography (PKC).
It uses the 'Hellman-Pohlig' system (with prime = 257) for the examples.  Obviously this isn't meant
to be secure!  It's just a way to illustrate encryption and decryption quickly and simply.
